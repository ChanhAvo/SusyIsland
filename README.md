# Instructions and features
Susy Island aims to guide players through challenges in the forest, help them navigate to the beach. Once there, players can purchase baits and engage in fishing along the beach. To succeed, players must catch five distinct fishes before nightfall and manage their energy to prevent exhaustion.

- Fishing:
  + There are four normal fishes and one squid that the players need to catch to win the game.
  + Besides fishes, players also have the chance to reel in trash items from the beach.
  + Each catch costs one bait and one energy.

- Trading with NPC_Merchant:
  + Purchase: The players can only buy baits
  + Selling: The players can sell fishes, and baits for a price. Selling trash items and coconuts does not make any profits. 
  + Note: Once the players sell the fishing rod, fishing is no longer available and game restart is required.

- Forest: There are some creatures and objects that the players can encounter in the forest
  + Damage pits: Randomly generated, stepping into these pits results in the loss of energy.
  + Crabs: Touching these creatures inflicts damage upon the players.
  + Healing pool: Players can revive energy by drinking water from healing pool.
  + Damage pool: Drinking water from this pool depletes energy.
  + Note: The two pools are indentical and players can not know which one until they drink the water.
 
- Other items:
  + Treasure: It is found along the path leading to the beach. The fishing rod is achieved after the treasure is discovered.
  + Coconuts: Freely spawned on the sand. The players can pick them up and heal themselves by drinking it.
