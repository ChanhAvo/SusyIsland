# Object - Oriented Programming Project - Susy Island 
Susy Island is a 2D gaming experience where players embark on an adventurous journey, aiming to achieve the ultimate goal of capturing valuable fishes along the beach area of Susy Island. The game was originally inspired by Stardew Valley - a famous country-life RPG game, later on, the team decided to adjust and add more features based on other sources of references. We hope that you will enjoy the game.
